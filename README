= Description
  An abstract base class for Windows synchronization objects.

= Installation
  gem install win32-ipc
   
= Synopsis
  There is no synopsis. Don't use this library directly. It is used as the basis
  for other libraries, such as win32-mutex, etc. Think of it as an interface.

= Notes
  Originally based on the Win32::Ipc Perl module by Gurusamy Sarathy.
  This library is a prerequisite for several other IPC related Windows gems.

= Known Bugs
  None that I know of. Please log any bug reports on the project page
  at https://github.com/djberg96/win32-ipc.
